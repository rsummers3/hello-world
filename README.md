Currently at El Camino College, enjoyging learing how to code.  

I have trouble beliving all this is free.  I've been working with computers for some time, but not not really coding.  
In the 1980's editors and compilers were expensive, and could be used for compartivly limited computing audience.  

Whelp, it's still here waiting for me to get to work.  Even works at home on an inexpensive chromebook.  Amazing.
