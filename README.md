Currently at El Camino College, enjoyging learing how to code. 
I have trouble beliving all this is free.  I've been working with computers for a long time. 
In the 1980's I spent a bunch of money on software for (editors and compilers) that weren't nearly as good as this. 


Whelp, it's still here waiting for me to get to work.  Even works at home on an inexpensive chromebook.  Amazing.
